      <p className="mb-4">
        I'm a tech enthusiast with a deep passion for AI and ML. My journey began at Ram Mohan Mission High School, where my curiosity for technology first took root. It blossomed into a full-fledged passion at DPS Ruby Park as I delved into the world of Computer Science.

        Currently, I'm in my 3rd year pursuing a B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I've built projects in real estate price prediction and natural language processing, and I'm skilled in Python, scikit-learn, and data science tools, with a focus on transforming data into actionable insights. My career objective is to innovate solutions in AI/ML that drive real-world impact.

        It all started with a sparkâ€”a fascination with how technology could unlock the mysteries of the universe, inspired by the genius of <em>Tony Stark</em>. Today, I channel that spark into crafting models that push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence, predicting stock markets, and evolving game AI.
